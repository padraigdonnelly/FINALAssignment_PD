        <h2>I had often struggled to communicate my own unique talents when trying to pitch myself, so I designed my own storyboard to stand out from the crowd!</h2>
        <h3>My storyboard is a visual representation of my own unique story on a single page. It highlights key achievements, skills, interests and experience. I have used it in job interviews, project proposals and any situation where I need to showcase my talents and direct the readerâ€™s attention to the most relevant areas of what I have to offer! If you're interested in my app, sign up to the waiting list.</h3>
